            <p class="style1">With 20 beds each, the dorms have a very friendly atmosphere. Additionally, our Female
                dorms have save and quiet location, own bathroom, kitchen, and nice view from the window.</p>

            <p class="style1">You can get a free personal locker, the desk can hold valuables overnight in the safe as
                well, but in general the dorm atmosphere is trusting and relaxed. The desk also provides sheets and
